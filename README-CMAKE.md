# Instructions for building GTFold with ``cmake`` (MacOS and Unix)

The ``cmake`` utility simplifies the build process for GTFold which originally 
used a ``Makefile`` generated by running the ``configure`` script and ``autotools``. 
The core of the ``cmake``-based build process is found in the ``CMakeLists.txt`` 
configuration file in the base directory. This script will build all of the 
utilities using ``g++`` in the ``gtfold-mfe`` directory, e.g., the 
following command line applications: 
``gtmfe``, ``gtboltzmann``, and ``gtsubopt``. 
Documentation for the usage and parameters to each of these 
programs is [found here](http://gtfold.sourceforge.net/guide.html). 

## Prerequisite: Installing ``cmake`` dependencies

### On MacOS (tested on 10.14/Mojave)

Using the Homebrew package manager, run the following command:
```bash
$ brew install llvm@11 libomp cmake
```
If any of the above commands fail due to an existing installation of the 
package, try running the following command instead:
```bash
$ brew upgrade llvm libomp cmake
```
The versions of the ``brew`` packages used for testing are ``libomp`` (**11.0.1**) and 
``cmake`` (**3.19.4**). 
The ``llvm`` package (**llvm: stable 11.1.0 (bottled)**) 
installs a more recent version of the ``clang`` compiler 
toolchain than ships with current MacOS builds. It is necessary to upgrade because 
the default ``gcc`` (symlinked to a dated ``clang`` binary by default) on Mojave/10.14 
is not modern enough to support the C++ standards we require for the GTFold build process.

### On recent Debian Linux variants (including Ubuntu)

Run the following commands to install compiler tools and 
the ``cmake`` utility:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake
```

## Building GTFold (MFE)

Run the following command at your terminal of choice:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gtDMMB/gtfold.git
$ cd gtfold
$ rm -rf CMakeFiles/
(On MacOS -- MacOS/10.14/Mojave Office Box)
$ cmake -v . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER="/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang" \
     -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER="/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang++" \
     -DCMAKE_C_LINK_EXECUTABLE="/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/ld.lld" \
     -DMAC_ISYSROOT_PATH="/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk/usr" \
     -DMACOS_OFFICE_BOX=1
(On MacOS -- MacOS/10.14/Mojave Mini Desktop Box)
$ cmake -v . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER="/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang" \
     -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER="/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang++" \
     -DCMAKE_C_LINK_EXECUTABLE="/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/ld.lld" \
     -DMAC_ISYSROOT_PATH="/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk/usr" 
(On Linux/Unix)
$ cmake -v . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLINUX_GCC=1
$ make clean && make VERBOSE=1
```
Notice that we have maintained three ``CMakeLists.txt`` files for compilation on two variants of patched 
MacOS 10.14/Mojave machines (using ``clang/clang++``), and one using the ``gcc/g++`` for Linux and other 
Unix like system variants. The ``g++`` compiler toolchain is more standard on Linux. 
Using ``clang++`` installed with the Homebrew ``llvm`` package is easier on current MacOS/10.14/Mojave builds. 
Because of subtle differences in ``XCode`` and/or ``CommandLineTools`` versions on different Mojave boxes, 
we have included two separate MacOS configurations that are used with ``cmake``. If one does not work, we 
recommend trying the other variant before posting a new issue about ``cmake`` related build failures.

### Developers: Cleaning the CMake generated files

Run the following command first if the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file has changed since the last 
build/re-compile of GTFold:
```bash
$ rm -rf CMakeCache.txt Makefile cmake_install.cmake CMakeFiles/
```

## Installing the binaries system wide

Run the following commands to put the newly built GTFold 
executables in the system path (from within the base ``gtfold/`` directory):
```bash
$ sudo cp gtfold gtmfe gtboltzmann gtsubopt /usr/local/bin
$ sudo chmod 0644 /usr/local/bin/{gtfold,gtmfe,gtboltzmann,gtsubopt}
```
Alternately, you can configure your local (``bash``) shell to alias these 
commands so that the binaries invoked by running the associated command name 
are linked at the current working directory, e.g., so that running 
``$ gtmfe [options]`` at the command line works directly regardless of the 
actual directory you are located in at runtime.

**(On MacOS):**
```bash
$ export gtfoldCwd="$(greadlink -f .)"
$ echo "alias gtfold='$gtfoldCwd/bin/gtfold'" >> ~/.bash_profile
$ echo "alias gtmfe='$gtfoldCwd/bin/gtmfe'" >> ~/.bash_profile
$ echo "alias gtboltzmann='$gtfoldCwd/bin/gtboltzmann'" >> ~/.bash_profile
$ echo "alias gtsubopt='$gtfoldCwd/bin/gtsubopt'" >> ~/.bash_profile
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```
Note that if ``greadlink`` is not found, you can install it using ``brew`` by running 
```bash
$ brew install greadlink
```
**(On Linux/Unix):**
```bash
$ export gtfoldCwd="$(readlink -f .)"
$ echo "alias gtfold='$gtfoldCwd/bin/gtfold'" >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo "alias gtmfe='$gtfoldCwd/bin/gtmfe'" >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo "alias gtboltzmann='$gtfoldCwd/bin/gtboltzmann'" >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo "alias gtsubopt='$gtfoldCwd/bin/gtsubopt'" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```
